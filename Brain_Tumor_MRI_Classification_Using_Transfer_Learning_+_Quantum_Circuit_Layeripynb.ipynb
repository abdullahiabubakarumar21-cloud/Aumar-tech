        "The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pennylane.qnn.keras'` strongly indicates an incompatibility issue between the installed PennyLane and Keras versions. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **PennyLane's `KerasLayer` and `tf.keras` (Keras 2.x)**:\n",
        "    *   Historically, PennyLane's `qml.qnn.keras.KerasLayer` was designed to integrate seamlessly with `tf.keras`, which is the Keras API integrated within TensorFlow. This typically refers to Keras versions prior to 3.x, often bundled with TensorFlow 2.x releases.\n",
        "    *   The `KerasLayer` utility relies on the internal structure and APIs of `tf.keras` to create quantum-classical hybrid models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Keras 3.x Architectural Changes**:\n",
        "    *   Keras 3.x (as installed, version `3.13.0`) represents a significant architectural shift. It is now a standalone deep learning framework that can run on multiple backends (TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch).\n",
        "    *   This decoupling from `tf.keras` means that the underlying structure and certain APIs that `pennylane.qnn.keras` expected are no longer present or have changed dramatically in Keras 3.x.\n",
        "    *   As a result, PennyLane's `KerasLayer` (which was built for the `tf.keras` integration) is not compatible with the new Keras 3.x architecture, leading to the `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import it from `pennylane.qnn.keras`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Potential Resolutions**:\n",
        "    *   **Downgrade Keras to 2.x (tf.keras compatible)**: The most straightforward solution is to uninstall Keras 3.x and install a version of TensorFlow that includes a compatible `tf.keras` (Keras 2.x). For example, installing `tensorflow==2.x.x` (where `2.x.x` is a specific version) would likely resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` by reverting to the Keras API that PennyLane's `KerasLayer` is designed to work with.\n",
        "    *   **Manual Integration for Keras 3.x**: If using Keras 3.x is essential, a direct integration using `qml.keras.SoleLayer` (or similar low-level Keras utilities) might be possible. This would involve manually defining the quantum circuit as a Keras Layer without relying on the higher-level `qml.qnn.keras.KerasLayer` utility. This approach requires more manual setup but offers flexibility.\n",
        "    *   **Check for PennyLane Updates**: Keep an eye on PennyLane's releases. Future versions of PennyLane might introduce a `KerasLayer` specifically designed to be compatible with Keras 3.x and its multi-backend architecture. However, as of PennyLane 0.43.1, this compatibility does not appear to be natively supported for Keras 3.x."
